### Finding and Recommendation
- 92.41% of the ordered goods were shipped and the rest were either cancelled, on hold, disputed e.t.c
- Classic Cars had the highest sales (3,842,869) while Train had the lowest sales (226,243).
- USA had the highest sales (3,355,576) and Ireland had the lowest sales (490).






The Status of the order was used as the slicer.
I went further to filter total sales by Productline (e.g Classic Cars) categorized by Dealsize, and discovered that Ships had only medium and small sales.
- More goods should be supplied to the South since it generates more revenue, this will help to increase sales turnover, more branches can also be established in the South.
- Different brands of shoes should be supplied to all regions, because customers seem to purchase more of it, and their purchasing interest should be sustained with multi-brand choice.
- I suggest that more investigation should be carried out on the West store to know the cause of its low sales.
- it could be that people don't wear Socks much, which causes the sales to be low. If the revenue is not more than the capital, I suggest it should be removed from the stores.
